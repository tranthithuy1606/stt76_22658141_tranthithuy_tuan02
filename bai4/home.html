            Scrapbook albums have existed since the beginning of photography. However, the sad fact is that photograps and most printed material are not pernanent: they will fade and yellow with age. Scrapbookers of today are aware of these problems, and the industry is providing remedies to minimize deterioration. For the best results, avoid using materials with high acid contet which can cause photos and oaoer to deterioate. Another thing to avoid is lignin, a material that is the bonding element in wood fibers. Over time, paper with lifnin will become yelllow and brittle, so you should only use lignin-free products.

            Your albums should contain page protectors to shield the pages from smudges, oil, and dirt that can be transferred from your hands. You should never use albums with sticky "magnetic" pages. The sticky substance will be trasferred to the photo and backing paper causing deterioration. Never crop Polaroid &#174; photos; they will curl and fall apart. mount all memorabilia on acid-free cardstock paper, and photocopy all newspaper clippings on acid-free paper.
